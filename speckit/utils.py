def find_Jdes_binary_search(scheduler, target_nf, **args):
    """Performs a binary search to find the `Jdes` for a scheduler.

    This utility function iteratively calls a given scheduler to find the
    integer `Jdes` (desired number of frequencies) that results in a plan
    with exactly `target_nf` frequency bins. It is designed to support the
    `force_target_nf` functionality in the `SpectrumAnalyzer`.

    The search is performed within a predefined range defined by `MIN_JDES`
    and `MAX_JDES`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scheduler : callable
        The scheduler function to be evaluated, e.g., `lpsd_plan` or `ltf_plan`.
    target_nf : int
        The target number of frequencies (`nf`) that the scheduler should generate.
    *args : tuple
        A tuple of the other arguments required by the scheduler, passed in a
        specific, fixed order: `(N, fs, olap, bmin, Lmin, Kdes)`. The function
        internally selects the correct arguments from this tuple based on
        which scheduler is provided.

    Returns
    -------
    int or None
        The integer value of `Jdes` that produces exactly `target_nf`
        frequencies. Returns `None` if the binary search completes without
        finding an exact match.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the provided scheduler function does not return a dictionary
        containing the key 'nf'.

    Notes
    -----
    - This function requires an **exact match**. If no integer `Jdes` within
      the search range produces `nf == target_nf`, the function will return `None`.
    - The `*args` parameter has a rigid structure and must contain the scheduler
      parameters in the order `(N, fs, olap, bmin, Lmin, Kdes)`, even if a
      specific scheduler (like `lpsd_plan`) does not use all of them.

def kaiser_alpha(psll):

    This function provides a polynomial approximation to determine the required
    shape parameter (`alpha`, often denoted as `β`) for a Kaiser window to
    achieve a desired Peak Side-Lobe Level (PSLL). This is useful because
    engineers often specify window performance in terms of sidelobe
    attenuation in decibels, whereas window generation functions require the
    `β` parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    psll : float
        The desired Peak Side-Lobe Level in positive decibels (dB). For example,
        a value of 200 corresponds to extremely high sidelobe attenuation.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The calculated shape parameter `alpha` (or `β`) for use in a Kaiser
        window function like `numpy.kaiser`.

    Based on the window's shape parameter (`alpha` or `β`), this function
    provides an empirically derived recommendation for the fractional overlap
    between segments in a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) or Welch's
    method analysis. Windows with higher sidelobe suppression (larger `alpha`)
    have a wider main lobe and thus require more overlap to avoid scalloping
    loss and ensure signal conservation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float
        The shape parameter `alpha` (or `β`) of the Kaiser window, which is
        typically the output from the `kaiser_alpha` function.
